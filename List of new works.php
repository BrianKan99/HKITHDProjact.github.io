Legislation and tourism demands have impacted the Bedouin tribes, eroding their traditions and knowledge. While initially finding balance, modern authorities overlooked the Bedouins' realities, solely prioritizing tourism. Recognized as part of UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage, my intention is to give visibility to the Bedouins' struggle through spatial design. By integrating Bedouin labor and economy into the landscape, I argue for their inclusion and coexistence within Petra, acknowledging their fundamental role in the site.">

Perhaps it stems from a preference for questioning rather than answering. I have long recognized that effecting change goes beyond meeting material needs. I ponder: How can design transcend tragedy and envision speculative futures? How can we imagine a progressive path for Beirut, a city scarred by trauma and war? My project, What could be, is not a design proposal but a product of inquiry, embracing both answers and uncertainties. It unveils a tapestry of collective futures—what exists, endures, fades, and the beauty found within plausible and improbable scenarios.">
