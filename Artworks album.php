I sculpted the clothes in the shape of the sinking island, representing discarded garments piling up. As the Earth's temperature rises, sea levels follow suit. Fast fashion trends promote excessive clothing consumption and disposal, leading to harmful pollutants during incineration. This artwork aims to raise awareness about the consequences of fast fashion. The layers of smaller islands depict the accumulation of discarded clothes, while the choice of red color signifies the urgency and danger of real islands facing submersion.">

Perhaps it stems from a preference for questioning rather than answering. I have long recognized that effecting change goes beyond meeting material needs. I ponder: How can design transcend tragedy and envision speculative futures? How can we imagine a progressive path for Beirut, a city scarred by trauma and war? My project, What could be, is not a design proposal but a product of inquiry, embracing both answers and uncertainties. It unveils a tapestry of collective futures—what exists, endures, fades, and the beauty found within plausible and improbable scenarios.">

Legislation and tourism demands have impacted the Bedouin tribes, eroding their traditions and knowledge. While initially finding balance, modern authorities overlooked the Bedouins' realities, solely prioritizing tourism. Recognized as part of UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage, my intention is to give visibility to the Bedouins' struggle through spatial design. By integrating Bedouin labor and economy into the landscape, I argue for their inclusion and coexistence within Petra, acknowledging their fundamental role in the site.">
